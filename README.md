# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). 

## Overview

This project is a Junior level challenge. The idea is to re-create design and functionality from scratch. I've modified some parts, as I've decided to build it with React instead of Vanilla JS. Overall, the project was great! I've learnt a couple new things like handling multiple inputs with one function, etc.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
